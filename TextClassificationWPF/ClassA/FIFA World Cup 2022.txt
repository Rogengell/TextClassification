Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will always be synonymous with each other, the same as Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, Mohammed Ali and Joe Frazier. Neither player has lifted the World Cup with their country. However, debates about who is the greatest will continue long after both players retire. 2022 could be their last chance to claim one of the top prizes in football history: the FIFA World Cup, for thirty-five-year-old Messi and Ronaldo, a couple of years his senior at 37 years old.  

Spanish sports journalist Alvaro Romeo believes Argentina is the stronger team and could help Messi claim the one thing missing from his glittering career.

"In 2014, it's a bit harsh to say, but when they reached the World Cup Final against Germany, it was a one-person show in a way with Messi. This time he's surrounded by better centre-backs and midfielders. I think that Argentina has a chance, and Lionel Messi will set his eyes on this World Cup as his last chance of winning it.

When it comes to Cristiano Ronaldo, it's slightly different. I feel this Portuguese side is not as good as Argentina at the moment. They have a lot of talent in the squad, but they qualified for the World Cup via the play-offs. That tells you this Portuguese side is not perfect. He needs the team to do a better job. In any case, they will have a hard time improving their results from Russia in 2018 when they failed to advance past the Round of 16."

Ronaldo and Messi will undoubtedly create headlines whether they delight or disappoint in Qatar, but they won't be alone in thinking this could be their last chance to shine on the world stage. Let's look at who could join them in the last chance saloon.
