Celtic's hopes of Champions League progression are over after they once again wasted chances before losing to RB Leipzig.

Ange Postecoglou's side knew they had to avoid defeat to have a realistic chance of progressing in the competition beyond the World Cup and had early chances through Matt O'Riley, Kyogo Furuhashi and Daizen Maeda.
Bad news for Celtic, though. Timo Werner and Emil Forsberg's goals at Celtic Park gave RB Leipzig a 2-0 win over the Scottish champions, who cannot now qualify for the last 16.

On Wednesday, it's the battle of Britain part two as Liverpool travel to Ibrox to face Rangers. The equation is pretty simple for both sides with Liverpool targeting a win to give them a strong chance of reaching the last 16. A defeat for Rangers would see them knocked out of the competition.
Tottenham host Eintracht Frankfurt at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a crucial game for Antonio Conte's side amid a tight Group D table. All four sides in the group still have hopes of reaching the knockout stages.
